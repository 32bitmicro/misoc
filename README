[> MiSoC system-on-chip
------------------------------

A high performance and small footprint system-on-chip design based on Migen.

MiSoC supports the Mixxeo and the Milkymist One.
Obtain your development system at http://m-labs.hk

[> Instructions (software)
--------------------------
1. Compile and install binutils. Take the latest version from GNU.
  mkdir build && cd build
  ../configure --target=lm32-elf
  make
  make install
  
2. Compile and install GCC 4.5. Take gcc-core and gcc-g++ from GNU.
  rm -rf libstdc++-v3
  mkdir build && cd build
  ../configure --target=lm32-elf --enable-languages="c,c++" --disable-libgcc --disable-libssp
  make
  make install

3. Obtain compiler-rt and set the CRTDIR environment variable to the root of 
   its source tree.
  svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk compiler-rt
  export CRTDIR=/path_to/compiler-rt

4. Build and flash the BIOS (part of this source distribution).
  cd software/bios
  make
  make flash

The second command requires m1nor-ng, FJMEM and UrJTAG.
These tools can be found at:
  https://github.com/m-labs/fjmem-m1
  http://urjtag.org
  
[> Instructions (gateware)
--------------------------
First, download and install Migen from:
  https://github.com/m-labs/migen

Once this is done, build the bitstream with:
  ./make.py [-p <platform>] -l
This will generate the build/soc-<platform>.bit programming file
and load it with UrJTAG.

A new BIOS needs to be built and flashed for MiSoC.
There is no compatibility with Milkymist SoC.

Enjoy!

         with UDP/IP hw stack and Etherbone frontend

[> Intro
---------
LiteEth provides a small footprint and configurable Ethernet core.

LiteEth is part of LiteX libraries whose aims are to lower entry level of
complex FPGA IP cores by providing simple, elegant and efficient implementations
ofcomponents used in today's SoC such as Ethernet, SATA, PCIe, SDRAM Controller...

The core uses simple and specific streaming buses and will provides in the future
adapters to use standardized AXI or Avalon-ST streaming buses.

Since Python is used to describe the HDL, the core is highly and easily
configurable.

LiteEth uses technologies developed in partnership with M-Labs Ltd:
 - Migen enables generating HDL with Python in an efficient way.
 - MiSoC provides the basic blocks to build a powerful and small footprint SoC.

LiteEth can be used as a Migen/MiSoC library (by simply installing  it
with the provided setup.py) or can be integrated with your standard design flow
by generating the verilog rtl that you will use as a standard core.

[> Features
-----------
- Ethernet MAC with various interfaces and various PHYs (GMII, MII, Loopback)
- Hardware UDP/IP stack with ARP and ICMP

[> Possible improvements
-------------------------
- add standardized interfaces (AXI, Avalon-ST)
- add DMA interface to MAC
- add RGMII/SGMII PHYs
- ... See below Support and consulting :)

If you want to support these features, please contact us at florent [AT]
enjoy-digital.fr. You can also contact our partner on the public mailing list
devel [AT] lists.m-labs.hk.


[> Getting started
------------------
1. Install Python3 and your vendor's software

2. Obtain Migen and install it:
  git clone https://github.com/m-labs/migen
  cd migen
  python3 setup.py install
  cd ..

Note: in case you have issues with Migen, please retry
with our fork at:
  https://github.com/enjoy-digital/misoc
until new features are merged.

3. Obtain LiteScope and install it:
  git clone https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litescope
  cd litescope
  python3 setup.py install
  cd ..

4. Obtain LiteEth
  git clone https://github.com/enjoy-digital/liteeth

5. Build and load UDP loopback design (only for KC705 for now):
  python3 make.py -t udp all

6. Test design (only for KC705 for now):
  try to ping 192.168.1.40
  go to ./test directory:
  change com port in config.py to your com port
  run make test_udp

7. Build and load Etherbone design (only for KC705 for now):
  python3 make.py -t etherbone all

8. Test design (only for KC705 for now):
  try to ping 192.168.1.40
  go to ./test directory run:
  run make test_etherbone

[> Simulations:
  Simulations are available in ./liteth/test/:
    - mac_core_tb
    - mac_wishbone_tb
    - arp_tb
    - ip_tb
    - icmp_tb
    - udp_tb
  All ethernet layers have their own model tested against real Ethernet dumps (dumps.py)
  To run a simulation, move to ./liteeth/test and run:
    make simulation_name

[> Tests :
  An UDP loopback example is provided and be controlled with: ./test/test_udp.py
  An Etherbone example with Wishbone SRAM is provided and can be controlled with:
  ./test/test_etherbone.py

[> License
-----------
LiteEth is released under the very permissive two-clause BSD license. Under
the terms of this license, you are authorized to use LiteEth for closed-source
proprietary designs.
Even though we do not require you to do so, those things are awesome, so please
do them if possible:
 - tell us that you are using LiteEth
 - cite LiteEth in publications related to research it has helped
 - send us feedback and suggestions for improvements
 - send us bug reports when something goes wrong
 - send us the modifications and improvements you have done to LiteEth.

[> Support and consulting
--------------------------
We love open-source hardware and like sharing our designs with others.

LiteEth is developed and maintained by EnjoyDigital.

If you would like to know more about LiteEth or if you are already a happy
user and would like to extend it for your needs, EnjoyDigital can provide standard
commercial support as well as consulting services.

So feel free to contact us, we'd love to work with you! (and eventually shorten
the list of the possible improvements :)

[> Milkymist-NG system-on-chip
------------------------------

This is the next-generation Milkymist(tm) system-on-chip design,
introducing two key innovations:
 * Built on the powerful Migen VLSI logic design system.
 * Increased system memory performance thanks to a new architecture
   (ASMI) containing a transaction-reordering and superscalar controller.

The Milkymist-NG SoC supports the Milkymist One board. Obtain yours at:
  http://milkymist.org

Note that the -NG version is still experimental work in progress. For the
production version of Milkymist SoC, visit:
  https://github.com/milkymist/milkymist

[> Instructions (software)
--------------------------
1. Compile and install binutils. Take the latest version from GNU.
  mkdir build && cd build
  ../configure --target=lm32-elf
  make
  make install
  
2. Compile and install GCC 4.5. Take gcc-core and gcc-g++ from GNU.
  rm -rf libstdc++-v3
  mkdir build && cd build
  ../configure --target=lm32-elf --enable-languages="c,c++" --disable-libgcc --disable-libssp
  make
  make install

3. Obtain compiler-rt and set the CRTDIR environment variable to the root of 
   its source tree.
  svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk compiler-rt
  export CRTDIR=/path_to/compiler-rt

4. Build and flash the BIOS (part of this source distribution).
  cd software/bios
  make
  make flash

The second command requires m1nor, FJMEM and UrJTAG.
These tools can be found at:
  https://github.com/milkymist/fjmem-m1
  http://urjtag.org
  
[> Instructions (gateware)
--------------------------
First, download and install Migen from:
  https://github.com/milkymist/migen

Once this is done, build the bitstream with:
  make
This will generate the build/soc.bit programming file.
Use:
  make load
to load it with UrJTAG.

The SoC expects a bootloader to be located in flash at 0x860000, just
like the legacy SoC did. However, there is no binary compatibility and a
new BIOS needs to be built and flashed for the -NG SoC.

Enjoy!

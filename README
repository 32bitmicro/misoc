[> Milkymist-NG system-on-chip
------------------------------

This is the next-generation Milkymist(tm) system-on-chip design,
introducing two key features:
 * Built on the powerful Migen VLSI logic design system.
 * Increased system memory performance thanks to LASMI.

This translates to more development productivity, better video resolution
and quality, ease of designing complex hardware accelerators, and much
more flexibility in hardware designs.

The Milkymist-NG SoC supports the Mixxeo and the Milkymist One.

[> Instructions (software)
--------------------------
1. Compile and install binutils. Take the latest version from GNU.
  mkdir build && cd build
  ../configure --target=lm32-elf
  make
  make install
  
2. Compile and install GCC 4.5. Take gcc-core and gcc-g++ from GNU.
  rm -rf libstdc++-v3
  mkdir build && cd build
  ../configure --target=lm32-elf --enable-languages="c,c++" --disable-libgcc --disable-libssp
  make
  make install

3. Obtain compiler-rt and set the CRTDIR environment variable to the root of 
   its source tree.
  svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk compiler-rt
  export CRTDIR=/path_to/compiler-rt

4. Build and flash the BIOS (part of this source distribution).
  cd software/bios
  make
  make flash

The second command requires m1nor, FJMEM and UrJTAG.
These tools can be found at:
  https://github.com/milkymist/fjmem-m1
  http://urjtag.org
  
[> Instructions (gateware)
--------------------------
First, download and install Migen from:
  https://github.com/milkymist/migen

Once this is done, build the bitstream with:
  ./make.py [-p <platform>] -l
This will generate the build/soc-<platform>.bit programming file
and load it with UrJTAG.

A new BIOS needs to be built and flashed for the -NG SoC.

Enjoy!
